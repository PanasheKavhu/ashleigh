Replace the three placeholder SVGs in this folder with your photos.

- Recommended filenames: img1.svg img2.svg img3.svg (or update `index.html` to match your filenames)
- Use JPG/PNG if you prefer; keep dimensions wide (e.g., 1200x700) for best results.

If you want to use real audio instead of the generated melody, add `assets/audio/song.mp3`.

Details:
- Filename: `assets/audio/song.mp3` (use MP3 for broadest browser support).
- The script will try to load and play this file when the carousel scrolls into view. If the browser blocks autoplay, a user interaction (tap/click) will allow playback.
- To disable the generated melody and force your MP3, add the file and the site will attempt to play it automatically.
